First import the class.

    import packageName.ClassName; 

If the method is static, you could simply do this:

    ClassName.method(); 

If it is not, you need to create a new object and call it on that:

    ClassName c = new ClassName(); 
    c.method(); 

For example, if I had a Dog class with a bark method and wanted to call that in another class, I would do this:

    Dog.bark(); 
    //or 
    Dog myDog = new Dog(); 
    myDog.bark(); 

This also applies for variables
